It standardizes how artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly large language models (LLMs), integrate and share data with external tools, systems, and data sources. MCP acts like a standardized connection, similar to a USB-C port, enabling AI applications to provide context to LLMs and connect AI models to various external data repositories, business tools, and development environments. The goal of MCP is to help AI models produce better, more relevant responses by seamlessly integrating with the systems where data lives.\\n\\nKey points about MCP:\\n- It is an open protocol for connecting AI assistants to external systems.\\n- It facilitates seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools.\\n- MCP provides shared memory, context, and goals for systems to work better together.\\n- It is gaining adoption with multiple MCP servers available for AI tool integration.\\n- MCP is seen as important for the future of AI and automation.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can visit:\\n- https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction\\n- https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol\\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol\\n- https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 262, 'prompt_tokens': 2127, 'total_tokens': 2389, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_178c8d546f', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BgsfMTjOYrVg9PHzHZUBpzO16EPRf', 'service_tier': None, 'prompt_filter_results': [{'prompt_index': 0, 'content_filter_results': {'hate': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'jailbreak': {'filtered': False, 'detected': False}, 'self_harm': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'sexual': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'violence': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}}}], 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'content_filter_results': {'hate': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'protected_material_code': {'filtered': False, 'detected': False}, 'protected_material_text': {'filtered': False, 'detected': False}, 'self_harm': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'sexual': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'violence': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}}}, id='run--966a0115-fa90-49da-9fa0-fdaebf4cff7d-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2127, 'output_tokens': 262, 'total_tokens': 2389, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]}\n"
